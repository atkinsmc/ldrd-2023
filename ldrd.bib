abstract="We describe the research and development work for the P2 experiment which aims for a high precision determination of the weak mixing angle {\$}{\backslash}sin^{\{}2{\}}{\backslash}theta{\_}{\{}W{\}}{\$}sin2$\theta$Wto a precision of 0.15{\%} at a four-momentum transfer of {\$}4.5{\backslash}times 10^{\{}-3{\}}{\$}4.5{\texttimes}10-3GeV2. This accuracy, comparable to existing measurements at the Z pole, allows for a sensitive test of the Standard Model up to a mass scale of 50 TeV, extendable to 60 TeV. The weak mixing angle is connected to the weak charge of the proton which will be extracted from a measurement of the parity violating cross section asymmetry {\$}-39.94 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-9{\}}{\$}-39.94{\texttimes}10-9in elastic electron-proton scattering. A total accuracy of {\$}0.57 {\backslash}times 10^{\{}-9{\}}{\$}0.57{\texttimes}10-9is achievable in a measurement time of 11000 h using a 150$\mu$A polarized electron beam impinging on a 60 cm liquid hydrogen target. The P2 asymmetry is smaller than any asymmetry measured so far in electron scattering with an unprecedented goal for the accuracy. The use of a solenoid spectrometer with 100{\%} {\$}{\backslash}phi{\$}Ï-acceptance as well as an atomic hydrogen trap polarimeter are new features, which have never before been used in parity-violation experiments. In order to collect the enormous statistics required for this measurement, the new Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) is under construction. Plans for the associated beam control system and the polarimetry are described in this article as well. A liquid hydrogen high-power target with an extremely low noise level of 10 ppm needs to be designed and constructed. We report in addition on the conceptual design of the P2 spectrometer, its Cherenkov detectors, the integrating read-out electronics as well as the ultra-thin, fast tracking detectors. The physics program of the MESA facility comprises indirect, high precision search for physics beyond the Standard Model, measurement of the neutron distribution in nuclear physics, single-spin asymmetries, and a possible future extension to the measurement of hadronic parity violation.",

The spectroscopic strength for the 1f and 2p knockout, integrated up to 10 MeV excitation energy, is much less than the missing strength in the 1d3/2 and 2s1/2 orbits, but it agrees with values expected from calculations involving ground-state correlations."

abstract = "An energy independent non-local optical potential for the elastic scattering of neutrons from nuclei is proposed and the wave-equation solved numerically in its full integro-differential form. The non-local kernel is assumed seperable into a potential form factor times a Gaussian non-locality. The potential form factor, of argument 1/2r+r'), is that of a real Saxon form plus an imaginary term having the shape of the derivative of a Saxon form. A real local spin-orbit potential of the usual Thomas form is included. The parameters of the potential obtained solely from the fitting of the differential cross sections for lead at 7 MeV and 14.5 MeV are used unchanged to calculate the elastic differential cross sections, total and reaction cross sections and polarizations on some elements ranging from Al to Pb at various energies from 0.4 MeV to 24 MeV. The S-wave strength functions and the effective scattering radius Râ² are also calculated with the same parameters. The parameters in the usual notations are: real potential V = 71 MeV, r = 1.22 fm, a = 0.65 fm; surface imaginary potential W = 15 MeV, a = 0.47 fm; non-locality Î² = 0.85 fm; spin-orbit potential, using the nucleon mass in the Thomas form, Uso = 1300 MeV. The energy independence of the potential parameters allows the compound elastic scattering to be included approximately at energies below 4 MeV. The calculations are compared to the data over the whole energy range, and the quality of the agreement with the data is found to be comparable to that obtained previously with energy-dependent local optical potentials. A âlocal WKBâ approximation to the integro-differential equation is derived and found to give an approximate relation between the non-local potential and the equivalent local optical potential."

The parameters of these models are fixed by fitting the properties of homogeneous bulk matter and closed-shell nuclei. We discuss and unravel the causes of correlations among the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei, the pressure of beta-equilibrated matter at a density of 0.1 fm - 3 , the derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy at the same density and the radii of moderate mass neutron stars. Constraints on the symmetry properties of nuclear matter from the binding energies of nuclei are examined. The extent to which forthcoming neutron skin measurements will further delimit the symmetry properties is investigated. The impact of symmetry energy constraints for the mass and moment of inertia contained within neutron star crusts and the threshold density for the nucleon direct Urca process, all of which are potentially measurable, is explored. We also comment on the minimum neutron star radius, assuming that only nucleonic matter exists within the star. "

   abstract={We determine an empirical dense matter equation of state (EOS) from a heterogeneous data set of six neutron stars: three Type-I X-ray bursters with photospheric radius expansion, studied by Ãzel et al., and three transient low-mass X-ray binaries. We critically assess the mass and radius determinations from the X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and radii. We introduce a parameterized EOS and use a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We find significant constraints on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars, and hence on the pressure-density relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry energy and the EOS near the saturation density are soft, resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11-12 km for M = 1.4 M â . The predicted EOS stiffens at higher densities, however, and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum mass is relatively large, 1.9-2.2 M â . Our results imply that several commonly used equations of state are inconsistent with observations.}

   abstract = "The ultimate goal of studying isospin physics via heavy-ion reactions with neutron-rich, stable and/or radioactive nuclei is to explore the isospin dependence of in-medium nuclear effective interactions and the equation of state of neutron-rich nuclear matter, particularly the isospin-dependent term in the equation of state, i.e., the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Because of its great importance for understanding many phenomena in both nuclear physics and astrophysics, the study of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy has been the main focus of the intermediate-energy heavy-ion physics community during the last decade, and significant progress has been achieved both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, a number of phenomena or observables have been identified as sensitive probes to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these interesting isospin-dependent effects and allowed us to constrain relatively stringently the symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities. The impact of this constrained density dependence of the symmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars have also been studied, and they were found to be very useful for the astrophysical community. With new opportunities provided by the various radioactive beam facilities being constructed around the world, the study of isospin physics is expected to remain one of the forefront research areas in nuclear physics. In this report, we review the major progress achieved during the last decade in isospin physics with heavy ion reactions and discuss future challenges to the most important issues in this field. "

This parametrization, called CH89, is based on the current understanding of the basis of the optical potential, such as the folding model and nuclear matter approaches. It differs significantly from previous global parametrizations, especially in the weakness of the isovector potential, the parametrization of potential radii, and the smooth variation of imaginary-potential depths with energy. We also describe an optical-model parameter search system, MINOPT, based on the minimization program MINUIT. It is applied to analyze simultaneously a large database of nearly 300 carefully selected angular distributions. Parameter uncertainties and correlations between parameters are estimated by using the non-parametric statistical technique known as the bootstrap method. CH89 is intended to serve as a starting point for definitive tests of models of the nucleon-nucleus interaction, and to be of immediate use of applications."

   abstract={A review of recent developments of the dispersive optical model (DOM) is presented. Starting from the original work of Mahaux and Sartor, several necessary steps are developed and illustrated which increase the scope of the DOM allowing its interpretation as generating an experimentally constrained functional form of the nucleon self-energy. The method could therefore be renamed as the dispersive self-energy method. The aforementioned steps include the introduction of simultaneous fits of data for chains of isotopes or isotones allowing a data-driven extrapolation for the prediction of scattering cross sections and level properties in the direction of the respective drip lines. In addition, the energy domain for data was enlarged to include results up to 200 MeV where available. An important application of this work was implemented by employing these DOM potentials to the analysis of the ( d, p ) transfer reaction using the adiabatic distorted wave approximation. We review these calculations which suggest that physically meaningful results are easier to obtain by employing DOM ingredients as compared to the traditional approach which relies on a phenomenologically-adjusted bound-state wave function combined with a global (nondispersive) optical-model potential. Application to the exotic 132 Sn nucleus also shows great promise for the extrapolation of DOM potentials towards the drip line with attendant relevance for the physics of FRIB. We note that the DOM method combines structure and reaction information on the same footing providing a unique approach to the analysis of exotic nuclei. We illustrate the importance of abandoning the custom of representing the non-local HartreeFock (HF) potential in the DOM by an energy-dependent local potential as it impedes the proper normalization of the solution of the Dyson equation. This important step allows for the interpretation of the DOM potential as representing the nucleon self-energy permitting the calculations of spectral amplitudes and spectral functions above and below the Fermi energy. The latter feature provides access to quantities like the momentum distribution, charge density, and particle number which were not available in the original work of Mahaux and Sartor. When employing a non-local HF potential, but local dispersive contributions (as originally proposed by Mahaux and Sartor), we illustrate that it is impossible to reproduce the particle number and the measured charge density. Indeed, the use of local absorptive potentials leads to a substantial overestimate of particle number. However from detailed comparisons with self-energies calculated with ab initio many-body methods that include both short- and long-range correlations, we demonstrate that it is essential to introduce non-local absorptive potentials in order to remediate these deficiencies. We review the fully non-local DOM potential fitted to 40 Ca where elastic-scattering data, level information, particle number, charge density and high-momentum-removal ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0954-3899/44/3/033001/jpgaa4139ieqn1.gif] {$(e,e^{\prime} p)$} cross sections obtained at Jefferson Lab were included in the analysis. All these quantities are accurately described by assuming more or less traditional functional forms for the potentials but allowing for non-locality and the abandonment of complete symmetry around the Fermi energy for surface absorption which is suggested by ab initio theory. An important consequence of this new analysis is the finding that the spectroscopic factor for the removal of valence protons in this nucleus comes out larger by about 0.15 than the results obtained from the NIKHEF analysis of their ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0954-3899/44/3/033001/jpgaa4139ieqn2.gif] {$(e,e^{\prime} p)$} data. This issue is discussed in detail and its implications clarified. Another important consequence of this analysis is that it can shed light on the relative importance of two-body and three-body interactions as far as their contribution to the energy of the ground state is concerned through application of the energy sum rule.}

This technique allows for cross-sections to be obtained with high statistical accuracy even for samples that are an order of magnitude smaller than those used with conventional (non-digital) techniques. The isotopic and energy dependence of rare-isotope total neutron cross-sections are of considerable value for extracting the n/p asymmetry dependence of optical-model potentials. "

The coincidence cross sections up to 21 MeV excitation energy were measured in the missing momentum range â40 < Pm < 280 MeV/c with an absolute precision of 4%. The achieved 130 keV energy resolution allowed to deduce momentum distributions Ï(Pm) for transitions to many discrete final states. A CDWIA analysis of the measured Ï(Pm) yielded rms radii of the single-particle orbitals and spectroscopic factors for the various transitions. The uncertainties in the analysis due to the treatment of the final-state interaction could be reduced by a combined analysis of the present data and elastic proton-scattering data in the same mass and energy region. The extracted spectroscopic factors are compared to those deduced from the (d3, He) reaction. The strength in the continuum (up to Ex = 21 MeV) has been decomposed into various orbital components by using the dependence of Ïnlj(Pm) on the values of n and l. Whereas in general the orbit radii and the binding energies are in fair agreement with the results of mean-field calculations, the total spectroscopic strength for valence orbits is only 40â60% of the single-particle sum-rule estimate. For deep-hole states we find 60â80%. These values are about 15% smaller than the predictions of recent mean-field calculations that include correlations. Possible origins of this difference are discussed."

   abstract={The different facets of the R -matrix method are presented pedagogically in a general framework. Two variants have been developed over the years: (i) The 'calculable' R -matrix method is a calculational tool to derive scattering properties from the SchrÃ¶dinger equation in a large variety of physical problems. It was developed rather independently in atomic and nuclear physics with too little mutual influence. (ii) The 'phenomenological' R -matrix method is a technique to parametrize various types of cross sections. It was mainly (or uniquely) used in nuclear physics. Both directions are explained by starting from the simple problem of scattering by a potential. They are illustrated by simple examples in nuclear and atomic physics. In addition to elastic scattering, the R -matrix formalism is applied to inelastic and radiative-capture reactions. We also present more recent and more ambitious applications of the theory in nuclear physics.}

The role of Coulomb distortion of electrons on the separation of these structure functions is investigated. The distorted-electron wave functions are given by an expansion in powers of ZÎ±, whose validity is discussed. The effect of electron distortion on the separation of longitudinal and transverse responses in parallel kinematics is considered, taking 40Ca and 208Pb as study cases. The effect is found to be significant. However, whereas for 40Ca it can be eliminated, with a good degree of accuracy, by correcting the cross section through effective momentum transfer, in 208Pb also large contributions due to the focusing of the electron wave must be carefully subtracted. The determination of longitudinal-transverse interference structure function in coplanar perpendicular kinematics is also discussed."

In this paper the non-relativistic Hamiltonian through second order in the nucleon recoil velocity is adopted; in the next paper higher order terms are included. The two approaches appear equivalent as far as the usual DWIA cross section is concerned, where a factorization occurs between the electron-nucleon cross section and the nucleon momentum distribution. However the unfactorized DWIA cross section behaves differently. This is attributed to a different off-shell behaviour of the two scattering amplitudes."

Results are presented and discussed for different nuclei in different kinematical conditions. Coulomb distortion gives two different effects. The first one is to change the momentum transfer into an effective momentum transfer. This effect is dominant for light nuclei and decreases by increasing incident electron energy. The second one is the focusing of the electron wave in the nuclear Coulomb field. This effect, almost energy independent, is sizeable in medium and heavy nuclei. It increases the cross section and in some cases becomes very large."

In particular the latter is important: most off-shell cross sections that have been used do not treat this correctly and, as a consequence, in the limit of the photon point give infinite photoabsorption cross sections."

   abstract = "The determination of the scattering matrix in the theory of nuclear reactions is essentially equivalent to the construction of the Green function for the SchrÃ¶dinger equation in the internal region of the configuration space with proper boundary conditions at the nuclear surface. This Green function can be expressed as the inverse of an operator involving the sum of the Hamiltonian and of a âboundary value operatorâ which is different from zero only on the nuclear surface where it has a singularity of the same kind as a Dirac function. A general operator expression for the scattering matrix is derived. This expression can be transformed into a matrix expression by introducing an arbitrary basis of orthonormal functions in the internal region. The Wigner-Eisenbud and the Peierls-Kapur formulations are obtained by an appropriate choice of the internal functions. When a large number of resonances contribute to the cross-section, the expansion of the scattering matrix in terms of resonances of the compound system is not useful, and a more appropriate starting point can be obtained from a perturbation expansion of the scattering matrix which is easily derived from the general operator expression. A simple statistical assumption is proposed in order to determine the dominant terms in such an expansion. It leads to the optical model for the elastic scattering and to the direct interactions for the inelastic scattering."

   abstract = "The Lagrange-mesh method is an approximate variational method taking the form of equations on a grid thanks to the use of a Gauss-quadrature approximation. The variational basis related to this Gauss quadrature is composed of Lagrange functions which are infinitely differentiable functions vanishing at all mesh points but one. This method is quite simple to use and, more importantly, can be very accurate with small number of mesh points for a number of problems. The accuracy may however be destroyed by singularities of the potential term. This difficulty can often be overcome by a regularization of the Lagrange functions which does not affect the simplicity and accuracy of the method. The principles of the Lagrange-mesh method are described, as well as various generalizations of the Lagrange functions and their regularization. The main existing meshes are reviewed and extensive formulas are provided which make the numerical calculations simple. They are in general based on classical orthogonal polynomials. The extensions to non-classical orthogonal polynomials and periodic functions are also presented. Applications start with the calculations of energies, wave functions and some observables for bound states in simple solvable models which can rather easily be used as exercises by the reader. The Dirac equation is also considered. Various problems in the continuum can also simply and accurately be solved with the Lagrange-mesh technique including multichannel scattering or scattering by non-local potentials. The method can be applied to three-body systems in appropriate systems of coordinates. Simple atomic, molecular and nuclear systems are taken as examples. The applications to the time-dependent SchrÃ¶dingerÂ equation, to the GrossâPitaevskii equation and to HartreeâFock calculations are also discussed as well as translations and rotations on a Lagrange mesh."

The single-particle potentials are adjusted to give the experimental centroid separation energies and configuration mixing is included using shell-model occupation probabilities.

A detailed analysis of these elastic scattering data and of other available data for p-shell nuclei is carried through, using various methods and a wide variety of assumed functional forms of the nuclear charge distribution. It is possible to fix rather accurately the spherically symmetric part of the charge distributions of Li6, C12, N14, and O16, and with less accuracy, those of Be9 and B11. Central densities are uncertain in all cases. Quadrupole scattering appears to be important in N14, in B11, and possibly in Be9, and a crude estimate of the quadrupole moment of N14 is inferred from the data. The quadrupole scattering depends sensitively on the source of the quadrupole moment, as well as on its value. Regularities within the p-shell are discussed, and connection made with the properties of heavier nuclei. Be9 and all heavier nuclei have a common value of peak particle density corresponding to a mean particle spacing of (1.13 Â± 0.01) Ã 10â13 cm. Only Li6 fails to reach this density of saturated nuclear matter."

   pages={617-621},
   abstract={The atomic nucleus is one of the densest and most complex quantum-mechanical systems in nature. Nuclei account for nearly all the mass of the visible Universe. The properties of individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) in nuclei can be probed by scattering a high-energy particle from the nucleus and detecting this particle after it scatters, often also detecting an additional knocked-out proton. Analysis of electron- and proton-scattering experiments suggests that some nucleons in nuclei form close-proximity neutron{\^a}EUR"proton pairs1{\^a}EUR"12 with high nucleon momentum, greater than the nuclear Fermi momentum. However, how excess neutrons in neutron-rich nuclei form such close-proximity pairs remains unclear. Here we measure protons and, for the first time, neutrons knocked out of medium-to-heavy nuclei by high-energy electrons and show that the fraction of high-momentum protons increases markedly with the neutron excess in the nucleus, whereas the fraction of high-momentum neutrons decreases slightly. This effect is surprising because in the classical nuclear shell model, protons and neutrons obey Fermi statistics, have little correlation and mostly fill independent energy shells. These high-momentum nucleons in neutron-rich nuclei are important for understanding nuclear parton distribution functions{\^A} (the partial momentum distribution of the constituents of the nucleon) and changes in the quark distributions of nucleons bound in nuclei (the EMC effect)1,13,14. They are also relevant for the interpretation of neutrino-oscillation measurements15 and understanding of neutron-rich systems such as neutron stars3,16.},

We consider observations made not only with photons, ranging from radio waves to X-rays, but also those involving neutrinos and gravity waves. We detail how precision determinations of structural properties would lead to significant restrictions on the poorly understood equation of state near and beyond the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. To begin, a theoretical analysis of neutron star structure, including general relativistic limits to mass, compactness, and spin rates is made. A review is the made of recent observations such as pulsar timing (which leads to mass, spin period, glitch and moment of inertia estimates), optical and X-ray observations of cooling neutron stars (which lead to estimates of core temperatures and ages and inferences about the internal composition), and X-ray observations of accreting and bursting sources (which shed light on both the crustal properties and internal composition). Next, we discuss neutrino emission from proto-neutron stars and how neutrino observations of a supernova, from both current and planned detectors, might impact our knowledge of the interiors, mass and radii of neutron stars. We also explore the question of how superstrong magnetic fields could affect the equation of state and neutron star structure. This is followed by a look at binary mergers involving neutron stars and how the detection of gravity waves could unambiguously distinguish normal neutron stars from self-bound strange quark matter stars."

The RMS deviation in the fit to masses was 0.655 MeV, and the calculated values exhibit no drastic discrepancies even for A = 3. Calculated sizes of nuclear charge distributions agree closely with measurements. Calculated fission barriers were compared with 40 measured values down to 75Br. For Z â©¾ 88 the agreement is almost perfect. For Z < 88 the trend of the measurements seems to confirm the expectation that the congruence energy should double its magnitude for strongly necked-in saddle-point shapes. A seventh (density-dependence) parameter in the effective interaction can be adjusted to ensure fair agreement with the measured energy-dependence of the optical model potential in the range from â70 MeV to 180 MeV. The model is used to predict properties of nuclear and neutron matter (including their compressibilities).

No free parameter is adjusted in the calculation; good agreement is obtained with empirical values. It is shown that the effective mass has a narrow maximum at the Fermi surface; this is investigated in the framework of analytical models."

The link between the reducible self-energy and the elastic nucleonânucleus scattering amplitude is also presented using the development of Villars. A brief summary of the essential elements of the multiple-scattering approach is also included. Several ingredients contained in the time-ordered Greenâs function are summarized for the formal framework of the dispersive optical model (DOM). Empirical approaches to the optical potential are reviewed with emphasis on the latest global parametrizations for nucleons and composites. Various calculations that start from an underlying realistic nucleonânucleon interaction are discussed with emphasis on more recent work. The efficacy of the DOM is illustrated in relating nuclear structure and nuclear reaction information. Its use as an intermediate between experimental data and theoretical calculations is advocated. Applications of the use of optical models are pointed out in the context of the description of nuclear reactions other than elastic nucleonânucleus scattering."

   abstract = "The fortran 77 code system elsepa for the calculation of elastic scattering of electrons and positrons by atoms, positive ions and molecules is presented. These codes perform relativistic (Dirac) partial-wave calculations for scattering by a local central interaction potential V(r). For atoms and ions, the static-field approximation is adopted, with the potential set equal to the electrostatic interaction energy between the projectile and the target, plus an approximate local exchange interaction when the projectile is an electron. For projectiles with kinetic energies up to 10 keV, the potential may optionally include a semiempirical correlationâpolarization potential to describe the effect of the target charge polarizability. Also, for projectiles with energies less than 1 MeV, an imaginary absorptive potential can be introduced to account for the depletion of the projectile wave function caused by open inelastic channels. Molecular cross sections are calculated by means of a single-scattering independent-atom approximation in which the electron density of a bound atom is approximated by that of the free neutral atom. Elastic scattering by individual atoms in solids is described by means of a muffin-tin model potential. Partial-wave calculations are feasible on modest personal computers for energies up to about 5 MeV. The elsepa code also implements approximate factorization methods that allow the fast calculation of elastic cross sections for much higher energies. The interaction model adopted in the calculations is defined by the user by combining the different options offered by the code. The nuclear charge distribution can be selected among four analytical models (point nucleus, uniformly charged sphere, Fermi's distribution and Helm's uniformâuniform distribution). The atomic electron density is handled in numerical form. The distribution package includes data files with electronic densities of neutral atoms of the elements hydrogen to lawrencium (Z=1â103) obtained from multiconfiguration DiracâFock self-consistent calculations. For comparison purposes, three simple analytical approximations to the electron density of neutral atoms (corresponding to the ThomasâFermi, the ThomasâFermiâDirac and the DiracâHartreeâFockâSlater models) are also included. For calculations of elastic scattering by ions, the electron density should be provided by the user. The exchange potential for electron scattering can be selected among three different analytical approximations (ThomasâFermi, FurnessâMcCarthy, RileyâTruhlar). The offered options for the correlationâpolarization potential are based on the empirical Buckingham potential. The imaginary absorption potential is calculated from the local-density approximation proposed by Salvat [Phys. Rev. A 68 (2003) 012708].

For projectiles with kinetic energies less than about 5 MeV, the programs can also compute scattering amplitudes and spin polarization functions. Method of solution: The effective interaction between the projectile and a target atom is represented by a local central potential that can optionally include an imaginary (absorptive) part to account approximately for the coupling with inelastic channels. For projectiles with kinetic energy less that about 5 MeV, the code performs a conventional relativistic Dirac partial-wave analysis. For higher kinetic energies, where the convergence of the partial-wave series is too slow, approximate factorization methods are used. Restrictions on the complexity of the program: The calculations are based on the static-field approximation. The optional correlationâpolarization and inelastic absorption corrections are obtained from approximate, semiempirical models. Calculations for molecules are based on a single-scattering independent-atom approximation. To ensure accuracy of the results for scattering by ions, the electron density of the ion must be supplied by the user. Typical running time: on a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4,1 the calculation of elastic scattering by atoms and ions takes between a few seconds and about two minutes, depending on the atomic number of the target, the adopted potential model and the kinetic energy of the projectile. Unusual features of the program: The program calculates elastic cross sections for electrons and positrons with kinetic energies in a wide range, from a few tens of eV up to about 1 GeV. Calculations can be performed for neutral atoms of all elements, from hydrogen to lawrencium (Z=1â103), ions and simple molecules."

We use the low-order correlation operator approximation (LCA) to compute the SRC contribution to the single-nucleon momentum distributions for 14 different nuclei from A=4 to A=208. Ten asymmetric nuclei are included for which the neutrons outnumber the protons by a factor of up to 1.54. The computed momentum distributions are used to extract the pair composition of the SRC. We find that there is a comprehensive picture for the isospin composition of SRC and their evolution with nucleon momentum. We also compute the non-relativistic kinetic energy of neutrons and protons and its evolution with nuclear mass A and NZ. Confirming the conclusions from alternate studies it is shown that the minority species (protons) become increasingly more short-range correlated as the neutron-to-proton ratio increases. We forge connections between measured nucleon-knockout quantities sensitive to SRC and single-nucleon momentum distributions. It is shown that the LCA can account for the observed trends in the data, like the fact that in neutron-rich nuclei the protons are responsible for an unexpectedly large fraction of the high-momentum components."

abstract = {We have observed Î²â-delayed proton emission from the neutron-rich nucleus 11Be by analyzing a sample collected at the ISOLDE facility at CERN with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). With a branching ratio of (8.3Â±0.9)â10â6 the strength of this decay mode, as measured by the BGT-value, is unexpectedly high. The result is discussed within a simple single-particle model and could be interpreted as a quasi-free decay of the 11Be halo neutron into a single-proton state.}

abstract = {We calculate the rate of the rare decay 11Be into Be10+p+eâ+Î½Â¯e using Halo effective field theory, thereby describing the process of beta-delayed proton emission. We assume a shallow 1/2+ resonance in the 10Beâp system with an energy consistent with a recent experiment by Ayyad et al. and obtain bp=4.9â2.9+5.6(exp.)â0.8+4.0(theo.)Ã10â6 for the branching ratio of this decay, predicting a resonance width of ÎR=(9.0â3.3+4.8(exp.)â2.2+5.3(theo.)) keV. Our calculation shows that the experimental branching ratio and resonance parameters of Ayyad et al. are consistent with each other. Moreover, we analyze the general impact of a resonance on the branching ratio and demonstrate that a wide range of combinations of resonance energies and widths can reproduce branching ratios of the correct order. Thus, no exotic mechanism (such as beyond the standard model physics) is needed to explain the experimental decay rate.}
